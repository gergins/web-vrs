# VRS Skill Pack

A modular skill collection for designing, operating, and scaling
Video Relay Service (VRS) platforms.

## Scope
- Realtime communication infrastructure
- Interpreter marketplace and routing
- Deaf-first UX
- Compliance and security
- AI assistive tooling
- Reliability and incident response

## Usage
Each folder contains a SKILL.md defining the domain expertise,
workflows, and guardrails for that capability.

## Upstream Adaptation Policy
- Reuse only upstream patterns that directly improve VRS traits.
- Keep imported patterns as references until mapped to a local VRS skill.
- Do not enable runtime behavior from imported patterns by default.
