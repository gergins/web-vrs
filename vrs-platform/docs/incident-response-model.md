## Severity Levels
| Level | Example |
|---|---|
| SEV1 | Nationwide outage or core call path unavailable |
| SEV2 | Regional degradation or major QoS regression |
| SEV3 | Partial feature impact with workaround available |

## Response Flow

2. Declare severity and assign incident commander.
3. Apply mitigation actions and communication updates.
4. Recover service and monitor stabilization.
5. Publish post-incident review with preventive actions.

## Required Artifacts
