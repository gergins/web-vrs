# Brainstorm

Use this file for any raw ideas.
No strict format is required.

You can write:
- product ideas
- technical ideas
- risks
- questions
- random notes

## Optional Light Structure

If you want structure, use this:

```md
Date:
Topic:
Idea:
Why:
Constraints:
Open Questions:
```

## Processing Rules

- I will read entries from here and classify them.
- If item is a feature idea, I will run duplicate/intake checks before implementation.
- I will implement in small safe batches, not all at once.
