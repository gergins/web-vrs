# Feature Brainstorm

Purpose: Capture raw feature ideas before backlog commitment, and record duplicate checks.

## Intake Workflow

1. Add candidate idea in the table below.
2. Run duplicate check:
   - `npm run feature:check -- "your feature idea"`
3. Record result in `Duplicate Check`.
4. If new, promote to `docs/product/feature-backlog.md` and apply gate scoring in `docs/product/feature-gate-matrix.md`.
5. If AI-related, also complete `docs/ai/intake/capability-intake-template.md`.

## Brainstorm List

| Idea ID | Feature Idea | Source | Date | Duplicate Check | Decision | Backlog ID | Notes |

npm run feature:check -- "fullscreen call controls with pinned self preview"
