# AI Roadmap and Module Architecture (Capability-First)

## Principle
The platform can support many AI features, but features are enabled only when policy, ethics, and market profile gates pass.

## Roadmap
### Phase 1 (0-12 months)
- live captions assist
- terminology assistant
- smart call routing assist
- optional transcript support
- baseline analytics

### Phase 2 (12-24 months)
- topic detection
- context panel
- workload insights
- predictive staffing
- quality monitoring

### Phase 3 (24-36 months)
- real-time prompting
- cognitive load balancing
- multimodal context engine
- interpreter training mode

### Phase 4 (36+ months)
- accessibility insights dashboard
- service planning intelligence
- cross-service integrations
- portable accessibility profiles

## Architecture Layers
1. Data ingestion: media/events/preferences
2. Real-time processing: speech/text/video feature extraction
3. AI intelligence: context/recommendation/workload/quality/forecasting
4. Application services: assist APIs, analytics/reporting, notifications
5. Governance and privacy: consent, minimization, encryption, audit, model registry

## Guardrails
- interpreter remains final decision-maker
- AI is assistive, never autonomous interpreter replacement
- enablement requires ethics + policy + country profile checks
- all AI actions auditable
