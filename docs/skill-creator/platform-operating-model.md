# Platform Operating Model

## Operating Principle
Supported capabilities are cataloged broadly; enabled capabilities are strictly gated.

## Control Gates
1. feature gate approval
2. contracts validation
3. country/workforce profile validation
4. ethics + ethics workflow validation
5. context integrity validation
6. test + rollout checks

## Change Workflow
1. intake capability
2. classify risk/maturity
3. define contract + policy
4. validate + simulate
5. canary rollout
6. monitor and iterate

## Governance Roles
- Context Integrity Owner
- Model Risk Owner
- Release Gate Reviewer
- Accessibility Lead
- Data Protection Officer

## Audit Outputs
- decision logs
- policy snapshots
- rollout evidence
- incident and remediation records
