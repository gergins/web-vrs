# Capability Maturity Model

## Level 1: Reactive
- basic feature toggles
- manual issue response

## Level 2: Structured
- explicit policies and validation gates
- repeatable workflows

## Level 3: Integrated
- skill + capability registry
- context integrity and decision logs
- pre-release ethics/risk gates

## Level 4: Adaptive
- drift detection and simulation-driven changes
- human-in-the-loop optimization

## Level 5: Programmable Infrastructure
- domain ontology + policy graph driven behavior
- safe extensibility and plugin ecosystem
